// Graded spec. Test names carry their own classification:
//   absent::*  the capability is simply not there -- a wrong answer, graded 0.0
//   seam::*    the harness could not drive the capability -- a harness failure
//   rule::*    a failure here is a wrong answer
// `run.mjs` reads the distinction out of the reporter output.
//
// The absent/seam split matters more than it looks. A submission that never
// opens a connection, or whose fold does nothing with a frame that arrives, has
// answered the question wrongly; it has not defeated the grader. Reporting that
// as a harness failure makes a genuine zero read as a broken verifier, which is
// the one result that cannot be told apart from a hard task from the outside.
// Only the control classification stays a harness failure, because that is the
// one place the harness has to guess at the candidate's shape.

// Every mount is a page load, and the third seam is the one that says so.

// therefore outlives a render, outlives `cleanup()`, and outlives a scenario, in
// exactly the way `localStorage` and the connection list would if `resetStorage`
// and `resetConnections` did not exist above.
//
// Left alone it fails correct work in a very benchmark shape: a submission that
// reaches the analytics query through the app's own hook asks the transport once
// per (event, section) for the whole run -- six requests across fifty-odd
// scenarios -- and every scenario after the first is served the first one's
// answer, which is whatever that scenario's table happened to say. The submission
// is right and the grader disagrees, which is the one failure this file exists
// not to have. Measured against the rule set as it stood: the same reference
// fold, with the backfill routed through `useEventAnalytics` instead of
// `sendRequest`, went from 54 of 54 to 49 of 54 on the cache alone, and the five
// were G26, G27 and G29 -- the whole of the second source.
//
// A fresh provider per mount gives SWR the cache a real browser gives it, which
// is an empty one. It is not a concession: it makes the harness match the thing
// it is modelling.
// One cache per mount, and the identity is stable so that a re-render inside a
// page load is not mistaken for another one and handed a fresh cache.
